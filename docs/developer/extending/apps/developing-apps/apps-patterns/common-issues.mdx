title: App Pattern - Common issues
---

### My app does not install

- check if you can access app manifest in your browser. In case of app-template it's on `api/manifest`. When inspecting, use tunnel in case of devserver
- navigate to dashboard and check if error message is available
- use debug flag to log APL debug logs

### Can't access app configuration

- set up debug flag for the browser and confirm that bridge can establish the connection
- check if requests on app configuration views are even triggered
- HMR sometimes causes the app context to drop connection with the app bridge. Reload the page

### Webhooks does not work

- confirm that webhook is created and is active (thru gql api)
- check if there are webhook invocations in the gql api
- make sure that application has permissions to access data specified in the query
- check if the subscription query is valid
- check the server logs to check if webhook was not rejected by app validation
- check webhook url (and server logs for 404 responses)
- application was not reinstalled after change of the manifest

### App can't query/mutate Saleor API

- check if gql client has set up tokens
- make sure you are sending queries to expected API endpoint
- check if app token was properly saved by the
- the app has not enough permissions

### Dashboard extension does not work

- reload browser, because available extensions are loaded when the dashboard starts up
- make sure you are not using wrong app mounting point (link reference to Extensions app)
- dashboard user does not have permission required by the extension
